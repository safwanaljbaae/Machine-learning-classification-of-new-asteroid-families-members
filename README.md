# Machine-learning-classification-of-new-asteroid-families-members
Repository for the codes necessary to identify new members of asteroid families.
Algorthms for the ExtraTree. KNN, XGBoost and Adaboost methods are provided with this
repository.  The first steps to set up the models are described below.

1) As a first step, create the proper element files for the asteroid region
of interest with the codes in the ZONE_SELECTION directory.  Read the Readme
file there for further instructions.

2) Copy the proper element file and the asteroid family in AFP format to
the CLASSIFICATION directory.  Follow the instructions in the local Readme
file to create the updated list of new family members.
